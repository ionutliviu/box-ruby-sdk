module Box
  # Represents an account on Box. In order to use the Box api, the user
  # must first grant the application permission to use their account. This
  # is done using OAuth2, which is performed externally to this library.

  class Account
    # Creates an account object using the given Box api key.
    # You can then {#register} a new account or {#authorize} an
    # existing account.

    # Authorize the account using the given auth token/ticket, or request
    # permission from the user to let this application use their account.
    #
    # An auth token can be reused from previous authorizations provided the
    # user doesn't log out, and significantly speeds up the process. If the
    # auth token if invalid or not provided, the account tries to log in
    # normally and requires the user to log in and provide access for their
    # account.
    #
    # A ticket can be used for applications that do not block on the user,
    # such as a website, where specifying a redirection url is not possible.
    #
    # In order to maintain backwards compatibility, a ticket can only be
    # specified in the hash syntax, while an auth token can be used in
    # either the hash or string syntax.
    #
    # @param [Optional, String, Hash{:ticket,:auth_token => String}] details
    #        Uses an existing auth token or ticket. If nil, a new ticket
    #        will be generated and used. If a String, it is assumed to be
    #        an auth_token (depreciated). If a Hash, then any values of
    #        the :ticket and :auth_token keys will be used to authenticate.
    # @yield [authorize_url] This block called when the user has not yet
    #        granted this application permission to use their account. You
    #        must have the user navigate to the passed url and authorize
    #        this app before continuing.
    # @return [Boolean] Whether the user is authorized.
    #
    # @example Authorize an account without a saved auth token.
    #   account.authorize do |auth_url|
    #     puts "Please visit #{ auth_url } and enter your account infomation"
    #     puts "Press the enter key once you have done this."

    # @example Authorize an account using an existing auth token.
    #   auth_token = "saved auth token" # load from file ideally

    # @example Combining the above two for the best functionality.
    #   auth_token = "saved auth token" # load from file if possible
    #   account.authorize(:auth_token => auth_token) do |auth_url|
